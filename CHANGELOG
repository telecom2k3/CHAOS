CHAOS.pm: Callouts, Handlers, And Other Stuff
https://github.com/telecom2k3/CHAOS

Version 1.2.1
Date: July 19.2021
	• Corrected a regex in the Fraud Baud(y) rules where a normalized UTF8 character appeared un-hexed.
	• Additional Fraud Subject and Fraud Body rules added.
	• Additional duplicate Exchange Header rule added.
	• New User-Agents added.
	• New X-Mailers added.
	• Fixed erroneous header match in check_email_greets Eval that triggered during during SA lint check.
Notes
There are no configuration file changes needed in this release.

Version 1.2.0
Date: June 21, 2021
	• New Eval, check_reference_doms() controls how many @domain.tld references can appear in a Reference header.
	• Strut your stuff and rock your wares with a new Eval, systeminfo(). This callout-only tags Emails with any combination of CHAOS, SpamAssassin, and PERL versions, followed by a description:
CHAOS: v1.2.0 SA: v3.4.6 PERL: v5.26.1 - This system rocks!
	• (Very)? Verbose versioning [-V, -VV] returns the Unicode Version of your PERL.
	• Continued additions to Admin Fraud and Fraud Body rules.
	• Additions to First Names, X-Mailers, User-Agents, Public Short URLs.
	• Fixed error messages thrown when check_email_greets() Eval handles Emails with only BCC recipients.
	• Complete removal of chaos_high and chaos_max score levels. CHAOS now pegs any of its scores to a single chaos_tag value.
Notes
Auto mode scoring has been changed in that any single rule hit will not force Emails to be tagged as spam.
Auto mode scores are simply an arithmetic fraction of the configured chaos_tag value.

Version 1.1.2
Date: May 20, 2021
	• All kinds of useful information added to mailer_check(); tons of stuff.
	• New checks for Identical and Multiple Headers added.
	• Exchange Header detection and sanity checking added.
	• All kinds of additional header sanity checks have been added.
	• New Eval, check_email_greets(), per SA-Users 5/7, "Hi $emailuserpart" - with internationalizations.
	• Complete Versioning is provided:
perl /$PATH_TO/CHAOS.pm [-v, --version] # CHAOS.pm, PERL, SA Version
perl /$PATH_TO/CHAOS.pm [-V, --verbose] # Above + PERL libraries for SA
perl /$PATH_TO/CHAOS.pm [-VV, --very] # Above + SA physical file paths
	• SendGrid Eval merged into mailer_check and now can generate two rules:
JR_SGRID_DIRECT (SendGrid or Partners)
JR_SGRID_FWD (Forwarded via ISP/References)
	• Cleanup of rule "Description" field output throughout the module.
	• Additonal additions to ADMIN_FRAUD Body AND Subject rules.
	• MMs added to Honorifics.
	• The ADMIN_FRAUD Body Eval/rule is commented out by default now in the CHAOS.cf file.
Notes
Parsing an Email body from within a plugin is neither easy or efficient. It is far better to have the rules compiled via sa-compile/re2c. The ADMIN_FRAUD Body rules are still there and have even been expanded; just commented out by default in the CHAOS.cf file.
I'm happy with the progress of the mailer_check() Eval. It is not quite a complete EMail fingerprint/signature kit, but there is now sufficient data returned to make it a good time to work towards publishing some rulesets.
Surprisingly, the Multiple Header detections have been quite useful at detecting infected Exchange Servers, particularly noted with the "X-MS-Exchange-CrossTenant-FromEntityHeader" header.
